Question 3
A man engaged 'n' labourers to make ’t’ toys in ’d’ days. Assume that all men work with same speed and efficiency. After 'd1' days, he found that only 't1' toys were made. Design an algorithm and write a Python code to determine the number of additional men to be employed to complete the task in time. For example, if n is 10, t is 320, d is 5, d1 is 3, and t1 is 120 then the number of additional men to be employed is 12. Assume that the speed of making toys is uniform for all men.

Input Format:
Read the number of labourers engaged in work
Read the total number of toys to be made (t)
Read the total number of days allotted for completion (d)
Read the number of days work had been done (d1)
Read the number of toys made in d1 days (t1)

Output Format:
Number of more men required for completing the job in allotted period

SOLUTION
import math
n = int(input("Enter the number of labourers :"))
t = int(input("Enter the number of toys to be made :"))
d = int(input("Enter the total number of days to make the toys : "))
d1 = int(input("Enter the number of days already worked : "))
t1 = int(input("Enter the number of toys made so far : "))

efficiency = t1/(d1*n)
toys_to_make = t - t1
rem_days = d - d1
add_lab = ((toys_to_make/rem_days)/efficiency)-n

if add_lab < 0:
    print("No additional labourers required")
else:
    print(f"{add_lab} additional labourers required")
