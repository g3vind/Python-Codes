Question 2

Students in a class are appreciated based on the following factors
Number of 'S' grade >= 3
Attendance >= 90
Participation in sports activity in a semester >= 2
Appreciation is given as follows: 
(i) 'Excellent' if all three conditions are met 
(ii)'Very Good' if conditions (i) and (ii) are met 
(iii)'Good' if conditions (i) and (iii) are met 
Given the Number of 'S' grades, Attendance and Participation in sports activity in a semester, write the python code to output the appreciation for the student. Check boundary conditions and print 'Invalid input' for wrong input.
Boundary Condition:
All values of input >= 0

Solution: 

noOfSGrades = int(input("Enter the number of s grades : "))
attendance = int(input("Enter the value of attendence : "))
sportsParticipation = int(input("Enter the value of sports participation : "))

if noOfSGrades >= 3 and attendance >= 90 and sportsParticipation >= 2:
    appreciation = "Excellent"
elif noOfSGrades >= 3 and attendance >= 90:
    appreciation = "Very Good"
elif noOfSGrades >= 3 and sportsParticipation >= 2:
    appreciation = "Good"
else:
    appreciation = "Invalid Input"

print("Appreciation : ", appreciation)
