Question 1

A team of authorities designed by Govt. of India to conduct a survey on Colleges. Let us assume ‘n’ number of colleges. They were asked to rank the colleges based on 3 different parameters. The parameters are facilities, academics and infrastructure. Maximum score in each parameter is as follows.
Facilities=25
Academics=50
Infrastructure=25
At the end of the survey the scores of the individual parameters are added up to get the total score and the colleges are ranked based on the score. The college that scores the highest score is ranked first. Next highest score is given the rank second and so on. Write a program to read the scores of the three parameters for each college, store the scores in a list. Make a list of individual score list for ten colleges. Find the total score for all ten colleges, and sort them. Print the Total score in the sorted (Descending) order. You have to use any sorting method for sorting.
Input format:
Read the scores for facilities for College 1 
Read the scores for academics for College 1 
Read the scores for infrastructure for College 1 
Read the scores for facilities for College 2 
Read the scores for academics for College 2 
Read the scores for infrastructure for College 2

---
Read the scores for facilities for College 10 
Read the scores for academics for College 10 
Read the scores for infrastructure for College 10 

Output format:
Total score in the sorted order (Descending)

Solution: 

n = int(input("Enter the no of colleges : "))
print("Number of colleges : ", n)
totalScore = []
for x in range(n):
    facilities = int(input(f"Enter facilities score for college {(x+1)}: "))
    acad = int(input(f"Enter the academics score for college {(x+1)}"))
    infra = int(input(f"Enter the infrastructure score for college {(x+1)}"))
    total = facilities+acad+infra
    totalScore.append(total)

totalScore.sort(reverse=True)
print("Total score in desecending order : ")
for x in totalScore:
    print(f"for college {x+1}", x)
